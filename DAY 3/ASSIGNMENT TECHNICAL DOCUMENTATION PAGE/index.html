            <p>Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing cognition,
                perception, and behavior. According to <span>World Health Organization (WHO)</span>, it is a <q>state of
                    well-being in
                    which the individual realizes his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can
                    work
                    productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her community</q>.
            </p>
            <p>It likewise determines how
                an individual handles stress, interpersonal relationships, and decision-making. Mental health
                includes subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational
                dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others</p>

            <header>History</header>
            <p>In the mid-19th century, <span>William Sweetser</span> was the first to coin the term mental hygiene,
                which can be
                seen as the precursor to contemporary approaches to work on promoting positive mental health.
                Isaac Ray, the fourth president of the American Psychiatric Association and one of its founders,
                further defined mental hygiene as <q>the art of preserving the mind against all incidents and influences
                    calculated to deteriorate its qualities, impair its energies, or derange its movements</q>.</p>
            <p><span>Emil Kraepelin</span> in 1896 developed the taxonomy of mental disorders which has dominated the
                field for
                nearly 80 years. Later, the proposed disease model of abnormality was subjected to analysis and
                considered normality to be relative to the physical, geographical and cultural aspects of the defining
                group.
            </p>
            <p> At the beginning of the 20th century, Clifford Beers founded <q>Mental Health America National Committee
                    for Mental Hygiene</q>, after publication of his accounts as a patient in several lunatic asylums, A
                Mind
                That Found Itself, in 1908 and opened the first outpatient mental health clinic in the
                United States.</p>

            <p>Prevention and mental health promotion can help all of us, whether we currently have good mental health
                or not. There are things we can all do to take care of ourselves and those around us. Prevention will
                mean different things to different people, depending on our past experiences and current circumstances.
                Some of the prevention methods are:
            </p>
            <p><code><span>Talk about your feelings:</span> Just being listened to can help you feel supported and less
                    alone with
                    any
                    problems youâ€™re going through. It's important to have someone to talk to when you're feeling
                    overwhelmed
                    or stressed.</code></p>
            <p><code><span>Stay active:</span> Regular exercise or activity can have a major impact on your mental and
                    emotional
                    health,
                    relieve stress, improve memory, and help you sleep better.</code></p>
            <p><code><span>Eat well:</span> Good nutrition will help you feel better physically but could also improve
                    your mood
                    and
                    decrease anxiety and stress. Eating a well-balanced diet can help you get enough of the nutrients
                    you
                    need.</code></p>
            <p><code><span>Get enough sleep:</span> Sleep affects your mood and ability to cope with stress. It's
                    important to get
                    enough sleep to help you feel refreshed and energized.</code></p>
            <p> <code><span>Practice mindfulness:</span> Mindfulness is a way to be fully engaged and present in the
                    moment. It can
                    help
                    you manage stress and anxiety, and improve your overall mental well-being.</code></p>
