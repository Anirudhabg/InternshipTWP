                        Being human can be complex, miraculous and sometimes difficult. Our
                        mental health can fluctuate throughout our lives, caused by any number
                        of internal and external factors. Thankfully, overtime, there has been
                        overdue but vital awareness and action surrounding mental health. As we
                        collectively, as a society, and individually come to understand the
                        importance of wellbeing that encompasses not just the body but the soul
                        and mind too. However, many things we now deem as social norms that can
                        also be taking a toll on our mental health.<br> Multiple studies have found
                        a strong link between heavy social media use and an increased risk for
                        issues like depression, anxiety and loneliness (HelpGuide). Meanwhile,
                        according to Re-wilding Britain, people in modern industrial societies
                        spend 90% of their time indoors in artificial, temperature-controlled
                        environments. There is a wealth of research that illustrates how
                        disconnection from nature is linked to mental and physical illness, from
                        anxiety and depression, to heart disease and fatigue.

                        Small daily
                        habits, or weekly rituals can often be enough to help us find the
                        balance we need to feel overall mental wellbeing. Mental wellbeing and
                        self-care looks different for everyone too. If you’re not sure where to
                        start or you’re looking for some inspiration to further boost your
                        wellbeing, we’ve put together a rather handy guide of our top ethical
                        products to help boost mental wellbeing.
